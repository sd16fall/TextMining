    "Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Project Gutenberg to find various plays from Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays are commonly categorized into two groups, Tragedies and comedies. I picked 4 of each to analyze. The tragedies I chose were Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and Othello. The comedies I chose were Twelfth Night, A Midsummer Night's Dream, All's Well That Ends Well, and Much Ado About Nothing. I used the Patern.en module to do sentiment analysis, modality analysis, and mood analysis of each play. I also used the scipy module to complete a two sample t-test on the numerical outputs to see if there were statistically significant differences between tragedies and comedies. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I had to do was download the text files from Project Gutenberg. There was a lot of text in each file that was not associated with the play itself, so I went through each to clean up the file by deleting any headers or footers from the text. After pushing these files to github, I was able to call them up from the jupyter notebook. I knew I wanted to see if there was a quantitative way to tell the difference between tragedies and comedies from Shakespeare. There were many ways that I could go about tying to do this by looking at the differences between the words in each. However, none of these were very quantitative. I was looking to get to a single number that I could use to compare plays. \n",
    "            \n",
    "I was able to calculate sentiment, modality, and mood for each text. I focused mostly on the polarity of the sentiment in how positive or negative the play was ranging from -1 to 1. \"The modality() function returns the degree of certainty as a value between -1.0 and +1.0, where values > +0.5 represent facts. For example, \"I wish it would stop raining\" scores -0.35, whereas \"It will stop raining\" scores +0.75.\" I went further to then calculate mood which \"returns  either INDICATIVE, IMPERATIVE, CONDITIONAL or SUBJUNCTIVE for a given parsed sentence.\" This was not a quantitative result but I thought it could be interesting to look at. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "        \n",
    "_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Pattern module, I was able to preform analyses that would output a number on the sentiment of the play by looking at how positive or negative the words were. The program takes a given sentience and computes its positivity(or negativity) based on the adjectives it contains. In the case of a string, it would take the average sentiment and report that. Pattern took each line from the play and computed sentiment and averaged the values for each text file. To help my understanding of what was going on behind the scenes, I ran code that took the entire script of Hamlet and split the file by line. It processed each line by removing punctuation and capitalization. A dictionary was then created with every word in the file and how often it occurred. Most of the more common words were common dictionary words that would be expected. This output wasnt very useful to examine. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "Pattern took each line from the specific text and calculated the three functions chosen. Since my main goal was to see the differences between the group of plays within comedy and tragedy, I took the polarity result from the sentiment analysis and preformed a two sample t-test from the scipy module by grouping the plays. The t-test concluded that there was a significant difference in the polarity of the tragedies and comedies. The test figured that, as expected, Shakespeare's comedies were more positive overall than his tragedies. This isn't much of a revelation but it is interesting that the computer was able to put our sentiments into a quantitative value that proved there was a difference. I was able to preform the same t-test for modality but the values were not statistically different. Most of the plays were either considered to be conditional or subjunctive. There wasn't a striking difference between the categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reflection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall it was interesting to see that the function was able to observe some differences between the plays and incorporate these into numerical values. However, with so few observations,  it is difficult to make any conclusions but as preliminary results we can infer that there are significant differences between the wording of Shakespeare's tragedies and comedies. It's obvious to us that there are differences because we have categorized them, but we can see that this categorization that we have figured out from careful analysis can be computed quantitatively by a computer almost instantenously. It would be interesting to see if these results follow with the remainder of his texts and even with how we generally categorize books or movies today. \n",
