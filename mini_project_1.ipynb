    "Project overview:\n",
    "    For the data, I used two books from_ the project glutenberg to analyze. I used the technique of counting the top\n",
    "    ten words that appeared in_ the book. Since the two book that I picked are religious books. One is_ about buddhism \n",
    "    and_ the other one is_ about christianity. I want to see how the top words in_ these two books can show the difference\n",
    "    of the two religion.\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "    The main logic of my analysis is_ create a dictionary that has all_ the words in_ the book as_ keys and_ everytime\n",
    "    the word shows up again, the value of the key increase by one. So that the frequency of all_ the words in_ the book\n",
    "    will be found. At the beginning I thought about weather I should download the book to the computer first or_ I should\n",
    "    just create a variable and_ set_ its value to be the book content. I decided to create a varaible so that all_ \n",
    "    computers will be able to use my code directly.\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "    The top ten words of the christianity book are god,Israel,Son,Man,King,People,We,Children,Land,and_ Father.\n",
    "    The top ten words of the buddhism book are Buddha,Life,India,Existence,Human,Ideas,Knowledge,Universe,Intellectual,\n",
    "    and_ China.\n",
    "    I think the words are definitely different. They all_ show the main idol of the religion. God and_ Buddha. They also\n",
    "    show the main place of the religion. Israel and_ India. The other words shows that Christianity is_ more about people.\n",
    "    The words like son, we, father, children shows Christianity is_ mainly about people and_ peoples relationship.\n",
    "    Differently, Buddhism words are more about thinking, about ideas. The words like life, idea, knowledge, universe,\n",
    "    intellectual.These words shows how Buddhism pay more attention on how people think and_ the importance of thinking.\n",
    "Reflection:\n",
    "    The process went pretty smoothly since I had a lot of similar practices in_ the completion of the reading journals.\n",
    "    One thing that I need to pay attention later on is_ that I need to be more careful about what format_ the imput is_\n",
    "    in_. Because the first time I run the code i got a count of each of the alphabetical letters in_ the book. That is_\n",
    "    because I didnot realize that the input_ isnot seperated by lines. So I over divided it and_ get all_ letters instead\n",
    "    of words.\n",
